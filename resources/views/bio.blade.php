  <h4>Timeline</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Ribbons of Euphoria is a combination of Psychedelic and progressive rock that blossomed at the end of 60’s and the 70’s. Their music is based on 60’s blues and rhythm & blues. Driven from different experiences and influncies of their band members, they combine these elements creating structured musical pieces, taking, at the same time, the advantage of rythmical and melodic improvisation.</p>
  <h5>1st Album - Ribbons of Euhoria</h5>
  <p>Their first release came at 2014 by D-drop Recordings. The tracks are a combination of many influencies and inspirations of the band from its founding (2007) till the production of the album with the first recordings in 2011. Within 2 years of much personal trouble and colaboration with 3 different studios, finally came the moment where this album was ready for its first official presentation on 26/12/2014. Nostalgic of the old times, Ribbons of Euphoria release their self-titled album in vinyl, distributed to the public through Fuzz Overdose Records.</p>

  <h5>2nd Album(EP) - Reaching for the Skies</h5>
  <p>Ribbons of Euphoria  return with their second release, promisingly entitled Reaching for the Skies. The rocking quartet from Athens-Greece, combine the 60’s psychedelic sound with the 70’s progressive aesthetics and approach. Pure rock, in large doses, satisfying even to the most demanding of the genre. Influences from Cream to Iron Butterfly and from Mountain to Camel and Uriah Heep are evident; however the approach is original and fresh. The EP includes two tracks of 17 minutes total play time. Rich compositions include impressive polyphonous orchestrations, organic and meaningful guitar riffs and beautiful orchestral parts, cleverly structured, where the organ and the guitar switch leading roles. Each hearing reveals little, hidden compositional treasures, as the music of the Ribbons best unveils itself to the faithful.</p>
